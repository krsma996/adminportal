# AdminPortal for Bookstore Application
AdminPortal is a standalone web application designed to manage the books for the Bookstore Application. 
The AdminPortal enables administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books, including managing book details and uploading cover images.

#Note:
AdminPortal and Bookstore are separate projects that run on the same database but different localhost ports:

AdminPortal: http://localhost:8081
Bookstore: http://localhost:8080
Prerequisites
Before running the AdminPortal, ensure the following:

#The Bookstore Application is running to initialize database tables.
Copy the dependencies and server configuration from the pom.xml file of the Bookstore project to the AdminPortal project to avoid errors in Spring Tool Suite (STS).
